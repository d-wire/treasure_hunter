Since the previous milestone, we have added several important features:
1. We have implemented a functioning google maps activity that loads up around the user's current location.
2. We have fully implemented data storage of the user's defined username.
3. We have fully implemented a quiz webservice with 3 endpoints corresponding to three different difficulties for the questions: "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard".
4. We have added a quiz activity to handle the quiz objects returned from the web service and present them in a nice format that records the user's responses.
5. We have added image overlays onto the google map of treasure chest objects that will correspond to quiz difficulties and associated loot.
6. We have given the treasure chest image overlays weighted probabilites so that easy chests are more common than medium chests which are more common than hard chests.
